Overview:
This Network Vulnerability Scanner is a Python tool designed to automate the scanning of IP addresses or IP ranges for open ports associated with common vulnerabilities. It also performs basic banner grabbing to identify services running on these ports. This tool is intended for network administrators and security professionals to assist in preliminary security assessments of networks.

Functionalities:
Port Scanning: Scans specified IP addresses or ranges for open ports from a predefined list of well-known ports.
Banner Grabbing: Attempts to identify and retrieve service banners from open ports to provide insight into the software running on the port.
Report Generation: Outputs a summary of open ports with service names and any obtained banner information.
Multi-threaded Scanning: Utilizes multi-threading to perform faster network scans.
User-Defined Scanning Range: Allows users to specify the range of IP addresses to scan.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed on the system.
Basic knowledge of network protocols and Python.

Installation:
Copy the Python script to your local machine.
No additional modules are required as the script uses standard libraries included in Python 3.x.

Usage Instructions:
Running the Scanner:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using Python: python network_vulnerability_scanner.py
Input Parameters:
When prompted, enter the network range in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
The scanner will start and perform the scanning process.
Interpreting Results:
The tool will output the results directly in the terminal.
For each IP address, it will list open ports along with the service name and any banner information retrieved.
If no common vulnerable ports are open, it will pass over it instead of flooding the terminal.
Exiting the Tool:
The tool will automatically exit after scanning the specified range.
You can manually stop the scan at any time by interrupting the process (e.g., Ctrl + C).
